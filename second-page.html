<h1><u>Famus Last Words</u></h1>
<h2>The Show Must Go On </h2>
<h2>from the album Two-Faced Charade</h2>
<img src="img/untitled.png ">
<p>I must accept these consequences for my actions
 when all I did was what the world told me I should<br./>
  <br/>
do And do anything for my dreams, if only i knew
<br/>
 the cost of my dreams, AKA, you.. would be you
 <br/>
 I'm dead now!
The nightmare
 is slowly taking over
 All that's happened
 It is enabling him
 to take exactly what he wants
 until he gets what he desires,
 we'll be at his whim
 My inner demon, he is screamin' at me, "Take her now!
 This is your only chance, won't get another, don't let me down.
 Don't fucking whine.
 the deed is done you'll be just fine.
 So you want true romance?
 throw the dice, take a chance."
 Why won't you let me in, just let me in!
 We'll masquerade this awkward phase that we're stuck in.
 If you accept me and forever be by my side...
