  <p>I must accept these consequences for my actions<br/>
 when all I did was what the world told me I should do<br/>
 And do anything for my dreams, if only i knew<br/>
 the cost of my dreams, AKA, you.. would be you<br/>
 I'm dead now!<br/>

 The nightmare<br/>
 is slowly taking over<br/>
 All that's happened<br/>
 It is enabling him<br/>
 to take exactly what he wants<br/>
 until he gets what he desires,<br/>
 we'll be at his whim<br/>

 My inner demon, he is screamin' at me, "Take her now!<br/>
 This is your only chance, won't get another, don't let me down.<br/>
 Don't fucking whine.<br/>
 the deed is done you'll be just fine.<br/>
  So you want true romance?<br/>
 throw the dice, take a chance."<br/>

 Why won't you let me in, just let me in!<br/>
 We'll masquerade this awkward phase that we're stuck in.<br/>
 If you accept me and forever be by my side<br/>
 Remember what I said? Every day's a new sunrise<br/>
 So let's just act pretend like this never happened<br/>
 I'm your arcane guardian<br/>
 Just let me in<br/>
